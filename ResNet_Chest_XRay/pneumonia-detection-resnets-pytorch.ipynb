    "This kernel was created after my dive into using **Pytorch**. PyTorch is python native, and integrates easily with other python packages, which makes this a simple choice for researchers. Many researchers use Pytorch because the API is intuitive and easier to learn, and get into experimentation quickly, rather than reading through documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I am using **Residual Network** (ResNet) via **transfer learning**, a popular deep learning neural network model, to classify Pneumonia chest X-ray scans. This dataset consists of around 5,000 and 600 images in the training and testing set respectively. It is quite small by today's big era standard, and it presents some challenges such as data imbalance that I will attempt to mitigate. By leveraging the power of transfer learning, we are able to 'transfer' the weights of low-level features (e.g., lines, shapes, etc) that were detected in a pretrained model. Doing so saves us the need to train a model from scrach, which can be challenging for those who do not have a 'big' enough dataset or computational resources.\n",

    "Now let us transform the images. Pytorch requires us to transform the images into tensors before loading the images when we need it for training. Doing so means that images are not all loaded at once, consuming most of your memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Resize and crop to 224x224 as many images are of different sizes\n",

    "**More about data augmentation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the **diversity** of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. Data augmentation techniques such as cropping, padding, and horizontal flipping are commonly used to train large neural networks. Note that it increase diversity by introducing random alterations of the original image, but it **DOES NOT INCREASE** the number of images/samples of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that it is generally recommended to do **channel-wise data normalization** on the images. This means that for each channel (RGB), we subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation of each channel of the entire dataset, from each pixel. This serves to prevent any color from having a wider influence/impact on the weights during training as one of the color can have a wider range in the dataset. When using transfer learning, it is recommended to normalize using the mean and standard deviation of the dataset that the pretrained model is trained on (Imagenet usually). However, for me, I found that normalizing decreases the performance, so I did not do it."

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our model performed reasonably well, as it manages to predict most of the pneumonia images. This is important as in healthcare diagnosis, accurate prediction of diseases saves lives. However, false positives can also increase the cost of healthcare, as more people with diseases are diagnosed with diseases. It can also lead to panic and affect people's physical and mental well-being. Better performance can be achieved with better tuning of the model hyperparameters. This is an iterative process, with lots of trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the difficulties that I faced for this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data class imbalance:** This is quite prevalent in the real world and as data scientists, we should all learn to embrace it and find ways to get around this problem. Usually, one way is to simply collect more data for the undersampled class. However, this is not possible for this dataset and especially for healthcare data, which is very difficult to collect and share. In this kernel, I used weighted loss to give more weights to the loss of the normal images. This weighting can be tuned as well to achieve the optimal performance. Stratified sampling is also important in this case, but pytorch does not yet have any built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overfitting:** This dataset is prone to overfitting as seen by the train and validation plots. Therefore, I only selected the model weights that achieved the best/lowest validation loss. However, sometimes the best validation loss are achieved in the early epochs, and it performs very badly on the test set, probably due to class imbalance when batching or sampling. For that reason, I have chosen to select the best validation loss only after certain epochs. I am not sure if this is a valid method. Please let me know if anyone has any comments on it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other methods that I tried but did not improve or even hurt performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learning rate scheduling using:** \n",
    "   * [**Step learning rate:**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/optim/lr_scheduler.html#StepLR) decays the learning rate of each parameter group by gamma every setp_size epochs.\n",
    "   * [**One fit cycle:**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/optim/lr_scheduler.html#OneCycleLR) The 1cycle policy anneals the learning rate from an initial learning rate to some maximum learning rate and then from that maximum learning rate to some minimum learning rate much lower than the initial learning rate. This policy was initially described in the paper [Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Neural Networks Using Large Learning Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120). Refer to this [post](https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html) to get a better understanding.\n",
    "* **Gradient Clipping:**  rescale/limit the values of gradients to a small range below a threshold to prevent undesirable changes in parameters due to large gradient values (exploding gradients), which makes the model unstable. Refer to this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48) for a better understanding.\n",
    "* **Weight Decay:** a regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term (a tunable constant, aka weight decay multiplied by the sum of squares of our model parameters/weights) to the loss function. Refer to this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-thing-called-weight-decay-a7cd4bcfccab) for a better understanding. `Loss = MSE(y_hat, y) + wd * sum(w^2)`\n",
